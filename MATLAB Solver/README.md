# urc_arm

The folder Arm contains the codes used for finding the link lenghts.

arm_link_solve has some issues that need to be solved in order to use


base is attached at 50cm, link lenghts - (50cm,40cm), gripper-27cm

i = 3 is gripper.

Angles q1 and q2 are constrained due to the linear actuator.
